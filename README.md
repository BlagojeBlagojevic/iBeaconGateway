# iBeacon Gateway with ESP32 for Position Estimation and Smart Camera Data Parsing

This repository features an **iBeacon Gateway** implemented using **ESP32** and **ESP-IDF**, primarily designed for position estimation using **BLE**. Additionally, it includes parsing data from a **Milesight smart camera**. The project uses MQTT to transmit data and integrates position estimation calculations based on RSSI values.

---

## 1. **Features**

- **BLE Scanning and Position Estimation:**
  - Scans for BLE iBeacon advertisements and calculates distances using RSSI values.
  - Filters UUIDs to ensure only relevant data is sent to the MQTT broker.
- **Position Estimation Formula:**
  - Implements distance estimation with the formula:  
    ```c
    RSSI = -10.0f * N * log10(distance) + RSSI(Distance.1m);
    Distance = 10^((RSSI - RSSI(Distance.1m))/(10 * N)).
    ```
- **Smart Camera Data Parsing:**
  - Parses event data from a Milesight smart camera for parking space monitoring and sends it to the MQTT broker.
- **JSON Data Formats:**
  - iBeacon data: Includes RSSI, distance, and spatial coordinates.
  - Camera data: Contains event type, timestamp, and occupancy information.

---

## 2. **How It Works**

1. **BLE Scanning and UUID Filtering:**
   - The ESP32 scans for nearby BLE iBeacons and filters data by UUID before processing and rssi.
   
2. **Position Estimation:**
   - Calculates distance from the beacon using RSSI values and predefined calibration parameters.


3. **Smart Camera Data Integration:**
   - Parses real-time data from a Milesight smart camera for parking space monitoring.

4. **Data Transmission via MQTT:**
   - Sends formatted JSON data to the MQTT broker for iBeacon and camera data.

## 4. **Hardware Requirements**

- **ESP32 Development Board** (e.g., ESP32-WROOM-32 or similar)
- One or more **iBeacon Devices**
- **Milesight Smart Camera** (optional)
- Wi-Fi network for data transmission
- Optional: Power supply, enclosures, and mounting equipment

---

## 5. **Software Requirements**

- **ESP-IDF Framework** (v4.x or later recommended)
- **MQTT Broker** (e.g., Mosquitto, AWS IoT, or HiveMQ)
- **Python 3.x** (for testing MQTT data or server-side applications)

---

## 6. **Setup and Installation**

### ESP32 Firmware
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BlagojeBlagojevic/iBeaconGateway.git
   cd iBeaconGateway-main
   ```
2. Install and configure ESP-IDF:
   - Follow the [ESP-IDF Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/).
3. Configure `config.h` with:
   - Wi-Fi credentials
   - MQTT broker details
   - UUID filter list

4. Build and flash the firmware:
   ```bash
   idf.py build
   idf.py flash
   ```

## 7. **JSON Data Formats**

### iBeacon Data
Data is sent to the MQTT broker in the following JSON format:
```json
{
  "refpower": 0,
  "uuid": "XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX",
  "majorID": 0,
  "rssi": -65,
  "minorID": 0,
  "time": "2024-12-09T12:00:00Z",
  "distance": 1.5,
  "x": 0.0,
  "y": 0.0
}
```

### Milesight Camera Data
Camera events are parsed and sent to the MQTT broker in this format:
```json
{
  "event": "Parking Space Detection",
  "device": "Network Camera",
  "time": "2024-12-09T12:00:00Z",
  "parking_area": "Area A",
  "occupancy": 5
}
```

---

## 8. **Testing**

- Power on the ESP32, iBeacon devices, and the Milesight camera.
- Monitor MQTT topics for iBeacon and camera data.
- Verify position estimation outputs match expected distances based on known RSSI values.
